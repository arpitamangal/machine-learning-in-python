# Dealing with high dimensional data: K-means Clustering & PCA
The code implements
* Data processing for high dimensional data
  - Null Values
  - Outliers
  - Scaling
* K-means clustering
  - Elbow method to choose optimal k
  - Change in initial cluster centroids and affect on the final clusters
* PCA to reduce dimension
  - Chooses optimal number of components
  - Transforms data on first two PCs (PC1 and PC2)
  - Transforms data on two original variables that have maximum loading on PC1 and PC2
* K-means clustering on reduced data using PCA
*Changes in cluster centers as K-means iterates to get optimum cluster centers.
